subtitle: I dabble in a bit of everything
---

I'm William McCann, a jack of all trades geek, a Computer Scientist and Cyber Security Enthusiast. I dabble in just about everything I can when it comes to IT, but my main passion is Information and Cyber Security. 

Browse my Github and you will see I have programmed in:

 - Android (I have three Apps on the Google Play store)
 - Python (Including applications in Flask and Django)
 - C# UWP
 - Java

I run my own Homelab at home, mostly based in Linux and I am constantly expanding my knowledge by introducing new things to my network all the time. 

This blog is a space for me to document my learning and professional development. Hopefully you find something here that is enjoyable and informative.
