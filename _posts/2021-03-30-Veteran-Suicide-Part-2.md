title: Enemy on the Homefront - Part 2 - The National Commissioner

[On 5 February 2020](https://www.nationalcommissionerdvsp.gov.au/), the Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the creation of the new National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention. The National commissioner is to examine ADF and Veteran deaths by suicide, with a main focus on supporting the prevention of future deaths. The National Commissioner will have Royal Commission-like powers to gather information and evidence, this includes by consulting with families and experts, as well as summoning witnesses. The National Commissioner will be independent from the Australian Government. This will enable them to independently inquire into the factors and systemic issues that contribute to deaths by suicide. It also enables them to play an enduring public accountability role. 

On 16 November 2020, Dr Bernadette Boss, CSC was appointed as the interim National Commissioner. As Dr Boss’s first priority she has immediately commence the [‘Independent Review of Past Defence and Veteran Suicides’](https://www.nationalcommissionerdvsp.gov.au/publications/terms-reference-independent-review). The objectives of this review are:
* Identify and understand the risk and protective factors relevant to past deaths by suicide among ADF members and veterans;
* Provide affected families the opportunity to share their stories, provide insights, and speak to the impact of the loss of their loved ones;
* Make recommendations to Government to inform more tailored and effective strategies for suicide prevention among ADF members and veterans; and
* Provide a foundation for the future work of the National Commissioner.

An interim report to government will be delivered within 12 months of commencing the review (By 16 November 2021) and a final report with recommendations to Government will be delivered in 18 months by 16 May 2022.  

[The National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention Bill 2020 was first introduced into the House of representatives on 27 August 2020. It was introduced to the senate on 9 November 2020 and is yet to pass parliament](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6587). 

## The Bill

The Bill to provide the powers required of the National Commissioner is yet to pass parliament. This is most notably due to the efforts of Senator Jacquie Lambie, the Labour Party and other cross bench senators, who believe that National Commissioner is a [‘Poor Man’s Royal Commission’](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/NationalCommissioner2020/Report/section?id=committees%2Freportsen%2F024541%2F75539). I should also note that the motion to support a Royal Commission into Veteran Suicide, which was unanimously supported by all houses originated in the Senate and was passed by the lower house, yet this Bill is yet to pass the Senate. 

Without this bill becoming law, Dr Boss will remain as the Interim Commissioner. How this impacts the [‘Independent Review of Past Defence and Veteran Suicides’](https://www.nationalcommissionerdvsp.gov.au/publications/terms-reference-independent-review) in unknown. Is this review even progressing? Is there any authority to actually undertake the review? Will the timelines remain the same? And how effective will this review be noting the desire for the National Commissioner to not even exist and instead a Royal Commission take its place. 

The Government is certainly at a stalemate with regards to this Bill. It seems unlikely to pass noting the current push for a Royal Commission. Sadly, due to this, it continues to further delay any action in this space to ultimately save lives. The Government seems to be in constant analysis paralysis. 

## The Mandate

It is clear that the National Commissioner has a mandate to focus on the prevention of future veteran suicides. This mandate has been somewhat at odds with the families of Veterans who have committed suicides who are demanding answers for why their loved ones have died. This here lies one of the key issues of the debate, we have people who are focused on the future – to prevent future veteran suicides, then have families and friends of veterans who have died by suicide who want answers and want to be heard. The Governments approach with the National Commissioner is the idea that they are looking forward to prevent future suicides, rather than looking back on what has occurred. Yet you cannot move forward without looking back. We need to understand what has occurred, what has failed, what the systemic issues are that contribute to this issue so we can fix them for the future. This is what a Royal Commission can do. 

Yet, one could argue that the review commissioned by Dr Boss on the day of her appointment is doing that. It is looking at the ‘risk and protective factors relevant to past deaths of suicide’. However, this will not achieve the outcomes some in the veteran community are after. They want people and organisations to be held accountable for what has occurred in the past to ensure it doesn’t happen in the future. Without the powers of a Royal Commission that the bill that is yet to pass is meant to give how can the National Commissioner effectively look into issues ranging from the management and funding of DVA, through to ADF Transition and support of ESO’s? All of these things are arguably contributing factors to Veteran suicide. 

## Independence

There are two aspects of concern when discussing the Independence of the Interim National Commission, Dr Bernadette Boss CSC. The first, which has been raised by Senator Jacqui Lambie is that Dr Bernadette Boss is a [long-time friend of then Defence Minister Linda Reynolds](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/review-of-veteran-suicide-scourge-at-risk-as-labor-opposes-commissioner-20201201-p56jni.html). Whether or not there is or isn’t an actual conflict of interest in the appointment, the important thing to note is that there is at least a perceived conflict of interest which can be harmful to the findings of the National Commissioner, potentially undoing any good work it can achieve.
The other aspect of concern is that the National Commissioner does not truly independent in that they are a former Military Officer. Organisations such as the [Royal Australian Regiment Corporation have highlighted to Government](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=committees/commsen/cb6834f3-2090-439a-b7c7-3b0c672a84ec/&sid=0000) the need to have a truly independent commissioner, where someone with previous service may come with pre-conceived ideas, beliefs and understandings of the military works and this would prevent them from being truly independent.

The other side to this argument is that it is easy to see how Dr Boss was selected. She was a star ranking officer within the Australian Army and an ACT Coroner. Therefore, she possesses the necessary skills to be able to deal with a topic such as Veteran suicide. However, this argument is also countered by the RAR Corporation, where they argue a truly independent and competent National Commissioner would surround themselves with suitable experts to allow them to understand the nuance and complexities of the topics they are dealing with (such as how the military works). 

## Analysis Paralysis

Royal Commissions have specified timeframes in which they must provide their outcomes and recommendations to Government. This allows those running the Royal Commission to plan accordingly to ensure they cover all aspects required to achieve an outcome. The concept of the National Commissioner is that of a ‘rolling Royal Commission’ – one that has no end date. The risk with this concept is – at what point does the National Commissioner say ‘Ok, that is enough information now for me to make a recommendation’. There is a risk of Analysis Paralysis, where you constantly look over the information and data and never arriving to a conclusion or decision. Without a clear framework to work from the National Commissioner is at risk of never making effective change.

To counter this point though – We have seen a clear timeframe for the National Commissioners Review of past suicides. Where the review is to be completed in 18 months. You could argue that is almost Royal Commission like, however my question is what happens from there? Are there more reviews to be established or does the National Commissioner wait for veterans to commit suicide? 

## Enduring 

This is one positive aspect of the National Commissioner and is in a way counter to the one made above, that is that the National Commissioner will be enduring. Royal Commissions end and their recommendations may or may not be implemented by Government. With the National Commissioner being enduring in nature, this means they should have the means to oversee the implementation of recommendations and push for when recommendations haven’t been implemented. It also provides them the unique opportunity to review recommendations, to see if they are fit for purpose and even potentially adjust those recommendations as the years progress. This is definitely something that Royal Commissions do not have and is a positive move for veterans. Consider this, is there anyone holding the Government account to implementing the recommendations from the most recent Royal Commission into the Banking Sector?  

## Conclusion

So where do we stand? The concept of the National Commissioner is a positive one – an independent body that has enduring Royal Commission like powers to investigate and recommend solutions to deal with the veteran suicide crisis. However, it is untested territory. We do not know where or how it will work. Will it be as effective or less effective as a Royal Commission? It is hard to tell. It is currently ineffective as the laws required to bring it in to effect are yet to pass parliament and there are considerable questions on the independence of the National Commissioner. 

I personally believe there is scope for the National Commissioner to be employed effectively whilst keeping all parties satisfied. Perhaps, if a Royal Commission is to be called the recommendations are passed to the National Commission to oversee their implementation and to test their effectiveness. Combined with ‘rolling Royal Commission’ powers this could be a highly effective solution that provides the assistance needed long into the future after a Royal Commission has ended.
