title: Enemy on the Homefront - Veteran Suicide Discussion - Part 1
tags: [Other]
---
This post will be different from my previous ones, in fact you may notice I haven’t posted since 2018 and this in part will detail why. For those that do not know, this blog has mostly been focused on Cyber Security and the research I have put into that field. For those who have looked at my LinkedIn you will have seen that I have served in the Australian Army, I medically discharged in 2019 after 13 years of service due to mental health conditions. This blog post attempts to breakdown the current debate about calls for a Royal Commission in to Veteran Suicide. This topic is emotional, the debate is passionate and for those who have been touched by it the feelings will always be raw. Yet, there is still inaction on the topic by our Government. [Despite passing a unanimous motion in parliament for the government to call a Royal Commission](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-22/parliament-backs-royal-commission-for-veteran-suicides/100021274), at the time of writing this nothing has been done.

I stated that there is debate on this topic, there is one side of the debate who are calling for a Royal Commission and those who are against a Royal Commission. This blog post will attempt to analyse this debate, attempt to remove the emotion and look at the facts for and against the calling of a Royal Commission. Can we find a solution? Can we paint a picture that makes it clear to both sides of the debate what needs to be done? We all know something needs to be done, yet we seem to be too busy arguing how to do it. The longer we wait the greater the more at risk we are of losing more Veterans to suicide.

From my view point and from what I have researched, there are two main arguments against the calling of a Royal Commission. The First, is that the Morrison government on 5 February 2020 announced that the Australian Government will establish a [National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention to inquire into and support the prevention of deaths by suicide of serving and former ADF Members](https://www.ag.gov.au/about-us/what-we-do/national-commissioner-defence-and-veteran-suicide-prevention) . The intention of this position is to be that of a ‘rolling royal commission’. The Prime Minister has stated this is his preferred option despite parliament [passing a motion to call a Royal Commission](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-22/parliament-backs-royal-commission-for-veteran-suicides/100021274)

The other viewpoint on opposing a Royal Commission is the view held by the Ex-Services Organisations Round Table (ESORT), which consists of a range of veteran organisations such as the RSL, Legacy, DVA, Defence Families Australia and many more. Their view is that a [Royal Commission should not be called](https://www.adso.org.au/media-release-esort-resolution-no-to-royal-commission/) because another inquiry would add further burden to families and those individuals, who, for a variety of reasons, suffer because of their service. The ESORT believe that the Government should instead implement in full the 24 recommendations from the [“The Constant Battle: Suicide by Veterans”](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Foreign_Affairs_Defence_and_Trade/VeteranSuicide/Report) inquiry from 2017. 

The argument on the other side is clear. It is from Veterans and their families who have all felt the pain of veteran suicide. The [facts](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/veterans/national-suicide-monitoring-adf-2020/contents/suicides-in-ex-serving-personnel-by-discharge-reason) are Ex-servicemen are 21% more likely to commit suicide when compared to the general public. Shockingly, for Ex-servicewomen they are 127% more at risk than the national average. The statistics are even worse for those who are discharged medically. There is a belief that the increased rate in veteran suicide is due to the systemic failings of organisations such as the ADF and DVA. Issues surrounding transition and post discharge care and compensation have resulted in Veterans taking their own lives.

I would like to note that the statistics used are the official statistics recorded by the [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/veterans/national-veteran-suicide-monitoring/contents/summary) and perhaps don’t paint the full picture. Suicide is a difficult thing to record and gather statistics, the Government can only rely on official data where suicide has been recorded as the cause of death by a coroner. There can be instances where another cause of death is recorded officially for a veteran, despite family and friends believing it to be suicide. I am aware there are other Veteran organisations who keep their own statistics on this and I am more than happy to share them in this forum if they are sent to me. 

So, we must understand when talking statistics and when talking about a decision to be made by Government we must all use the same official data sets, yet acknowledge that the problem may be far greater than what the numbers indicate.

Those calling for a Royal Commission believe that this is their best means to get answers and make meaningful changes to save Veteran lives. Questions have been raised over the National Commissioner plan, from its independence through to its functions and how it can achieve its aims. Whilst the “Constant Battle” Inquiry addressed the issue, not all of its recommendations have been implemented and it was completed 5 years ago. Since that time the official statistics have not changed (they only go to 2018 so it is hard to really measure).  Therefore, a proper royal commission with the power to hold people to account is what those in the Veteran community are after.  

The key thing is everyone knows what the issue is and I want to make this clear – all sides of the debate want the same outcome, to understand why veteran suicides rates have increased and to help prevent occurrences of veteran suicide. At the end of the day the argument is about how do we best achieve that goal. 

This blog post is will be in a number of parts to make it easier to read: 
-	Part 1: Understanding the problem
-	Part 2: The National Commissioner for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention
-	Part 3: The Constant Battle Inquiry
-	Part 4: My Personal Story and why this matters

It is hoped that this look at the issue can inform everyone to understand the debate and perhaps to come to some consensus on the best way forward. The important thing is we need to act and do something – we may well be in analysis paralysis whilst we debate which was is best forward. So which way do we go? Do you prefer the 80% solution delivered on time or the 100% solution delivered too late? 

I am welcome to input to those who may be far more educated on the matter than I, please use my contacts page to pass any relevant information that you believe should be included in this analysis of the issue.
