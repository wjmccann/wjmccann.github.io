I have just published my first Boot to Root VM titled - Raven. 

I assess this as being a easy to intermediate VM to complete. There are four flags in total to get and I designed it with two intended ways of getting to root. 

I have also emailed the good people at Vulnhub and hopefully it will be featured there sometime soon. Until then you can [Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pCFv-OXmknLVluUu_8ZCDr1XYWPDfLxW) the VM from my Google Drive. 

If you complete it, please comment below to let me know what you thought!
